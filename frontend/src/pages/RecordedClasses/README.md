- ✅ Language and level filtering
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Progress tracking with visual indicators
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Files Created
1. `src/pages/RecordedClasses/RecordedClasses.jsx` - Main component
2. `src/pages/RecordedClasses/RecordedClasses.css` - Styling
3. `src/pages/RecordedClasses/index.js` - Export file

## Enhanced Services
- Added new methods to `lessonService.js` for better recorded lesson support:
  - `getRecordedLessons()` - Fetch video lessons specifically
  - `getLessonsByLanguage()` - Filter by language
  - `getUserLessonProgress()` - Get user's progress
  - `markLessonAsWatched()` - Track viewing progress

## Integration Steps

### 1. Add Route to App.jsx
```jsx
import RecordedClasses from './pages/RecordedClasses';

// Add this route inside your Routes component:
<Route path="/recorded-classes" element={<RecordedClasses />} />
```

### 2. Add Navigation Link
Add a link to your navigation components:
```jsx
<Link to="/recorded-classes">Recorded Classes</Link>
```

### 3. Backend Requirements
Ensure your backend supports these endpoints:
- `GET /api/lessons/recorded` - Get recorded video lessons
- `GET /api/lessons/progress` - Get user progress
- `POST /api/lessons/:id/watch` - Mark lesson as watched

## Component Props
The RecordedClasses component doesn't require any props as it manages its own state.

## Customization
You can customize the component by:
- Modifying the CSS variables in `RecordedClasses.css`
- Adjusting the filtering options
- Changing the grid layout (currently responsive 1-3 columns)
- Adding additional lesson metadata

## Sample Data Structure
The component expects lessons with this structure:
```javascript
{
  _id: "lesson_id",
  title: "Lesson Title",
  description: "Lesson description",
  type: "video",
  duration: 30, // minutes
  content: {
    videoUrl: "https://...",
    videoThumbnail: "https://..."
  },
  course: {
    _id: "course_id",
    title: "Course Title",
    language: "japanese",
    level: "A1"
  }
}
```

## UI Features Match
The component recreates all features shown in the reference image:
- ✅ Header with "Self-Paced Language Lessons" title
- ✅ Filter controls (Language, Level, Sort)
- ✅ "Continue Learning" section
- ✅ "All Lessons" section
- ✅ Video thumbnails with play buttons
- ✅ Progress indicators
- ✅ Language flags/icons
- ✅ Duration badges
- ✅ Status badges (Complete, In Progress, Start Learning)

## Responsive Design
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet: Two column layout  
- Desktop: Three column layout

## Error Handling
- Loading states with spinners
- Error messages with retry functionality
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Network error handling

The component is now ready to use and will provide a professional, polished interface for self-paced language learning that matches the design requirements.
